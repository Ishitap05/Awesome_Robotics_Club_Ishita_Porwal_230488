I have choosen Gyrobot:a self balancing robot.The first time I saw the this project offered by Robotics Club I had made my mind that I had to take this project.Building Robot always seems fascinating and interesting to me . I feel that I can give my 100% in this project and that's the reason it was my first priority.I strongly desire to build a robot and see it moving and performing task in front of me . I hope my task are correctly done and I get selected for this project
